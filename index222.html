  { text: "We all need to become new people who have become the body of Jesus (cf. Gal 2:20). Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "The bright kingdom of heaven, in which there is neither law nor sin, where only freedom, peace and love overflow, is just getting closer. Even if you open all 66 books of the Bible, there is nothing bigger and better than Shincheonji. That at the sound of the last trumpet, the kingdom of the world becomes the kingdom of God, the sound of the trumpet sent to the pastors - let us sound it loudly and proclaim it. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "Let us always turn our ears to the will of God and of Jesus, which is given to us by the promised pastor. In order to carry out the words of the overcomer for Him, we must work with the utmost diligence and with all our heart and strength. The warnings and rebukes of the chairman are the path that guide us to life. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "Now is the time when a world ends and finds its completion. We have now become the white horses and the horsemen and have come to the end, and we must receive God and the kingdom of heaven that is coming. Let us receive them in a healthy form. What must naturally take place must take place. 'Love' (Sa-rang): let us not forget these two syllables. We are one. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "This knowledge that we have been given has not been given to anyone else in the world. As we saw in Rv 14, this new song has only been given to the 144,000 from Mount Zion. It cannot be that someone is indolent after experiencing such grace. You must do well. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "You should always hunger and thirst for righteousness and be able to ask from others what you do not know. We should all humble ourselves and build a world that heaven desires. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "You have the seed of God and the Spirit of God is given to you, why can you not do it? We can do it, we should not be weak. We should not be preaching weakly in missionary work either. We are God's instruments. The one who guides me is the angel. The angel did not come without a command. He comes because God commanded it and sent him. Therefore, we must trust God and the angel, be obedient and proclaim with courage 'I can do it'. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "Religious people must lead a life of faith in which the Holy Scriptures are the standard. A life of faith in which the holy scriptures are the standard can result in an unification of religions, the kingdom of heaven can be restored on earth, and the light of heavenly culture will be spread so that a new world will be realized. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "If you call yourself a believer, you must do what you have to do as a believer before you seek any blessing from God. Instead of just asking to receive blessings like an underage believer, as a believer you should first do what you absolutely have to do. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "The spirits of God's throne work like lightning, noises and strikes of thunder. When we become one, there will be nothing that is impossible. We are not worldly, we are heavenly. Why are you afraid of worldly people? We have triumphed. Glory to our God for His victory! Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "You should not say to the Father God, who has departed to a far place, 'May you give blessings, may you make it prosper'. If you are a mature believer, and you are aware of God's point of view and position, you should fight against the enemy and overcome him. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "What is even more delightful is that this world is now coming to an end and we will live together with God for eternity. Now it is exhausting, difficult and painful, but the fruits that follow are tremendous. Therefore, we must all become one heart and one will. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "Therefore, because from all the nations of the world, He has loved us so much, we should also love God and, if it is God's will, we should act accordingly, no matter what it is about. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "The God of righteousness expects his Shincheonji children to have an outcome that matches the talents he has given them. 'It is said that much is entrusted to the one who is faithful in what is least.' Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "If the outward appearance is good, it might please people. But the eye of the spirit is bright and knows very well the hearts of people. The spirit will therefore never marry with one who is lazy or has an evil heart. We must strive to build our temple of the heart. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "The fact that I persevere even though I sometimes want to cry, am miserable and want to give it all up is just for the sake of doing God's work. Yeast of Life" },
  { text: "Just as it is said that even a bowl of cold water does not just pass by, but deserves to be appreciated, so God will remember the people who are supporting this work today. Yes, if you have received the word, you should also do mission work. Why do you not act? It is about the spiritual trading, which you should do. Yeast of Life" }
